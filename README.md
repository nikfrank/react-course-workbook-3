# react course workbook 3

here we'll work with components, state, and props.

we're building an event planning page with three tabs

- promotion details (img urls, name, blurbs)
- shopping list
- invitations


and we'll see that our App.js is getting unmanageable.

So we'll split each tab into a separate component!

then we'll have to learn about props so we can keep our state at the top.
